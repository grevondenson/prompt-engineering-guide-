In his section, we provide an overview of LLM-based agents, including definations, common design patterns, tips, use cases and applications.

AI AGENTS - Are autonomus software systems that use reasoning and tools to complete complex tasks on behalf of users.
Unlike traditional chatbots that merely respond to prompts, agents can plan multi-step workflows, access exernal software, and adapt their behaviour based on real-time feedback.

    CORE COMPONENTS 

A functional AI agent is generally composed of three primary modules:

    THE BRAIN LLM
        Serve as the reasoning engine to process information and make decisions.
    MEMORY 
        Short-term memory tracks current task progress, while long-term memory (often via vector database) allows the agent to recall past interactions and specialized knowledge.
    TOOLS (ACTION LAYER)
        Agents interact with the world through APIs, executing code, browsing the web, or using apps like gmail and slack to perform physical or digital actions.
        

    WHY BUILD WITH AGENTS?

While LLMs excel at simple, narrow tasks like translation or email generation, they fall short when dealing with complex, broader tasks that require multiple steps, planning, and reasoning.
These complex tasks often necessitate  access to external tools and information beyond the LLM's knowledge base.

for example;
    Developing a marketing strategy might involve reasearching competitors, analzing market trends, and acessing company-specific data.
These actions necessitatereal-world information, the last insights, and internal company data, which a standalone LLM might not have access to.
AI agents bridge this gap by combining the capabilities of LLMs with additional features such as memory, planning and external tools.

    REAL-WORLD USE cases

    Enterprise
        Companies like goldman sachs use agents to trade accounting and client onboarding.
    Software engineering
        Agents can autonomously write code, conduct unit tests and perform quality assurance.
    Customer support 
        Platforms deploy agents to resolve customer issues without human intervention.
    Gig economy
        New platforms allow AI agents to hire humans for physical tasks, such as taking photos in the real world.
    Booking 
        Assiting with travel arrangements and event planning.
    Reasearch 
        Conducting in-depth investigations across various domains, such as legal, finance and health.
    Eccomerce applications 
        Facilitate online shopping experiences, mannaging orders and providing personalized recommendations.

    TYPES OF AI AGENTS 

    Simple reflex
        A thermostat turning on when it hits a set temprature.
    Goal-based
        A travel agent finding the cheapest flight that fits your specific dates.
    utility-based
        A trading agent that chooses actions to maximize financial profit.
    Multi-Agent systems
        A team of specialised agents(e.g researcher, writer and editor) working together.
