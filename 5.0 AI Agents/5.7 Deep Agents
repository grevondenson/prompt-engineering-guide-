Most agents today are shallow. They easily break down on long, multi-step problems (e.g deep research or agentic coding)
We are entering the era of "Deep Agents", systems that strategically plan, remeber, and delegate intelligently solving very complex problems.

Here's roughly the core idea beind Deep Agents ( based on my own thoughts and notes that i've gathered)

    PLANNING 
        Deep agents maintain structured task plans they can update, retry and recover from.
        Think of it as a living to-do list that guides the agent toward its long-term goal.
        To experience this, just try out Claude code or codex for planning; the results are significantly better once you enable it before executing any task.

    Orchestrator & Sub agent architecture 
        This is the most powerful LLM based agentic architectures you can leverage today for any domain you can imagine.
        An Orchestrator manages specialized sub-agents such as search agents, coders, analyst each with its own clean context and domain focus 
        The Orchestrator delegates intelligently, and subagents execute efficiently.
        The Orchestrator integrates their output into a coherent result.

    Context retrieval and Agentic search 
        Deep agents do not rely on converstaion alone
        They store intermidiate work in external memory like files, notes, vectors or databases letting thek reference what matters without overloading the model's context.
        High quality structured memory is a thing of beauty 

    Context Engineering
        One of the worst thing you can do while working with deep agents is underspecifying instructions/prompts.
        Prompt Engineering is important.
        The instructions need to be more explicit, detailed and intentional to define when to plan, when to use sub agent, how to name files, and how to collaborate with humans.
        It also involves efforts around structured outputs, system prompt optimization, compacting context, evaluating context effectiveness and optimizing tool definations.

    Verification 
        Next to context Engineering, verification is one of the most important components of an agentic system.
        verification is basically verifying outputs, ehich can be automated or done by a human.
        Verification helps making your agents more reliable and more production ready.
        You can build good verifiers by leveraging systematic evaluation pipelines
