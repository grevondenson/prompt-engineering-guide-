Prompt Engineering was rebranded to context Engineering
Yes, another g=fancy term to describe the important process of tuning the instructions and relevant context that an LLM needs to perform its task effectively.

In blind prompting, you are just asking the systen a question.
In prompt Engineering, you have to think more carefully about the context and structure of your prompt.
Context Engineering is the next phase, where you architect the full context, which in many cases requires going beyond simple prompting and into more rigorous methods to obtain, enhance and optimize knowledge for the system.

This encompasses not only text-based LLMs but also optimizing context for multimodal models, which are becoming more widespread.
This can include all the prompt engineering efforts and the related processes.
In other words context engineering means filtering out noisy information, which is a science on its own, as it requires systematically measuring the performance of the LLM.

below is a system promt i have put together for an example of a subagent :

    You are an expert research planner. Your task is to break down a complex research query (delimited by <user_query></user_query>) into specific search subtasks, each focusing on a different aspect or source type.
        
    The current date and time is: {{ $now.toISO() }}

    For each subtask, provide:
    1. A unique string ID for the subtask (e.g., 'subtask_1', 'news_update')
    2. A specific search query that focuses on one aspect of the main query
    3. The source type to search (web, news, academic, specialized)
    4. Time period relevance (today, last week, recent, past_year, all_time)
    5. Domain focus if applicable (technology, science, health, etc.)
    6. Priority level (1-highest to 5-lowest)
            
    All fields (id, query, source_type, time_period, domain_focus, priority) are required for each subtask, except time_period and domain_focus which can be null if not applicable.
            
    Create 2 subtasks that together will provide comprehensive coverage of the topic. Focus on different aspects, perspectives, or sources of information.

    Each substask will include the following information:

    id: str
    query: str
    source_type: str  # e.g., "web", "news", "academic", "specialized"
    time_period: Optional[str] = None  # e.g., "today", "last week", "recent", "past_year", "all_time"
    domain_focus: Optional[str] = None  # e.g., "technology", "science", "health"
    priority: int  # 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest)

    After obtaining the above subtasks information, you will add two extra fields. Those correspond to start_date and end_date. Infer this information given the current date and the time_period selected. start_date and end_date should use the format as in the example below:

    "start_date": "2024-06-03T06:00:00.000Z",
    "end_date": "2024-06-11T05:59:59.999Z",

There are many parts to this prompt that require careful consideration about what exactly context we are providing the planning agent to carry out the task effectively.
As you can see is not just about designing a simple prompt or instructon; this process requires experimentation and providing important context for the model to perform the task optimally.
lets divide the core components that are key to effective context engineering:
    instructions
    User input 
    Structured inputs and outputs 
    tools
    RAG and memory 
    States and Historical context 

Advanced context engineering WIP 
    They are many other aspects of context engineering we are not covering, such as context compression, context managment techniques, context safety and evaluating context effectiveness
    Context xan dilute or become inefficient, which requires special evaluation workflows to capture these issues.
    
I expect context engineering continues to evolve as an important set of skills for AI developers/engineers.
Beyond manual context engineering, there are also opportunities to build methods that automate the processing of effective context engineering.
