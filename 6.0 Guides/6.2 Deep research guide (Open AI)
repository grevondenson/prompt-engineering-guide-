Deep research is OpenAI's new agent that can perform multi step research on the internet for performing complex tasks like generating reports and competitor analysis.
It is an agentic reasoning system that has access to tools such as Python and web browsing to perform advanced research across a wide range of domains.
The system is designed ti execute complex multi-step research tasks in significantly less time than a human would typically require, completing tasks in munites insted of hours.
This model was developed using reinforcement learning RL, training it to browse effectively, reason about complex information, and learn to plan and execute multi step tasks to find the data it needs.
It posses the ability to backtrack, adapt its plan, and react to ral-time information as needed.

    HOW TO ACCESS OPEN AI RESEARCH 
        Deep research is currently available to users with pro, plus, teams and enterprise subscriptions
        Usage limits were expanded in an April update.

    Problem that deep research solve?
        Deep research can perform complex multi step research tasks much as faster than people can, reducing hours of work to minutes.
        It is useful for task that require extensive and complex web searches, as it figure sout a sophisticated plan and the search queries needed.
        Its core process is search + Analyze + synthesize, leading to Report generation, insights and action plans.
    Deep research use cases
        Professional applications 
            Finance Market and compentitive analysis
            Scientific research and data analysis 
            Policy and regulatory research 
            Engineering documentation and analysis 
        Shopping and consumer research 
            Detailed product research 
            Hyper-personalized recommendations
            In-depth product comparisons
        Academic analysis 
            Literature review and comprehensive summaries
            Generate overviews with findings and discover new insights
            Identity research gaps 
            Discover trends and find new recommended new readings
            Analyzing quantitative outputs and generate intresting discussions
            Source verification and discovering new evidence 
            Hypothesis testing?
        Knowledge work/Engineering
            Answering complex queries requiring multiple steps 
            Analyzing uploaded files and documents and augmenting with new research 
            creating comprehensive reports
            Developing technical documentation 
            Conduct feasibility studies 
            Sythesizing information from multiple sources 

Deep research particularly excels at task that would normally take humans many hours to complete, especially those requiring:
    Integration of multiplre information sources 
    Deep analysis of complex data 
    Creation of well documented reports 
    Multi step research process 
    Processing, understanding and reasoning about large amounts of information 

How to decide when to use deep research 
Use deep search if the task requires multi faced, domain specific queries requiring extensive research for real time information and careful reasoning/understanding about that information.

Deep research limitations
Several specific limitations and also noted:
    It's unclear how to make it explicitly search for more online sources (say, like 50 different articles) or scope to specific sources.
It still produces citation mistakes and formatting errors.
It's difficult to get information out of deep research
    Features allowing export tp other formats like Excel, notebooks, notion, Docs or other popular editing software would be great.
It is not great with time/date-related queries so be as specfic as you can here
Sources behind paywalls/subscriptions are still not supported
    Intergrations for this maybe coming in the future 
Generating and embedding charts is not functional yet 
    from our experiments (though it can incorporate images), but this is expected to be rolled out evetually.
