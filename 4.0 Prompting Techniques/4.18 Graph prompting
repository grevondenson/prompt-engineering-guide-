It is a new framework for graphs to improve performance on dowmstream tasks.
It is an advanced ai technique that uses graph-structured data where information is organized as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) to guide model's reasoning.
This approach is used in two distinct ways 
    Graph-of-thought which structures the AI's internal reasoning process as a non-linear graph.
    Graph Prompt learning which adapts pre-trained graph models to new tasks without full retraining.

    GRAPH OF THOUGHT (GOT) REASONING 
    It allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, backtrack to fix errors, and merge insights from different thoughts.
        Thought transformation 
            Thoughts can be aggregated (combined), refined (improved through self-connection), or used to generate multiple new branches.
        Key modules 
            A controller manages the execution plan, while a scorer evaluates the quality of each "thought" node to rank the most relevant ones.
        Efficiency 
            GoT often reduces latency and error in complex tasks like sorting, keyword counting, oc set intersection.

    GRAPH PROMPT LEARNING (GNNs)
    It is a pre train, prompt, and predict paradigm.
    Instead of fune-tuning the entire model for every new task, lightweight trainable prompts are added to bridge the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives.
        Data level 
            Modifies the input graph by adding prompt vectors to node features or inserting prompt nodes into the structure.
        Representation level 
            Applies learnable prompts directly to the output or hidden layers of the model to filter relevant proir knowledge.
        Task level 
            Reformulates downstream tasks (like node classification) to match the pre training task (like link prediction)
