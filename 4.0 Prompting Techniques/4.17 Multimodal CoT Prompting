Traditional CoT focuses on the language modality. In contast, Multimodal CoT incoperates text and vision into a two stage frameworks.
The first step involves rationale generation based on multimodal information.
This followed by the second phase, answer inference, which leverages the infomative generated rationales.

M-CoT prompting extends the standard CoT technique by incorporating information from multiple data types such as text, images and audio into a step-by step reasonng process.

    HOW IT WORKS 
    THE TWO STAGE FRAMEWORK 

    Most M-CoT systems follow a structured pipeline to prevent "hallucinations" (generating incorrect logic)
        Rationale generation 
            The model analyzes a multimodal input (e.g a question + a diagram ) and generates a textual rationale or step by step explanation grounded in the visual evidence.

        Answer Inference 
            The model uses its own generated rationale, alongside the priginal text and image, to determne the final answer.

    
    CORE APPLICATIONS 
        Scientific reasoning 
            Analyzing a physics diagram and explain the forces at play step by step 
        Healthcare 
            Comparing a patients medical history with an X ray to diagnose a condition 
        Technical support 
            Analyzing a photo of a broken device and generating a troubleshooting sequence.
        Autonomous systems 
            Correlating camera feeds with navigation data to plan safe driving routes.


    KEY BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS 
    BENEFITS 
        It significantly imporves accuracy on benchmarks like ScienceQA and provides a traceable reasoning path that users can verify.

    LIMITATIONS 
        It requires more computational tokens, which increases latency and cost. Additionally, small models may still struggle with overthinking simple visual cues.
