It is an advance prompting technique that focuses on structral and syntactical aspects of tasks and problems rather than their specific content details.
The goal is to construct more abstract, structured way of interacting with LLM, emphasizing the form and pattern of information over traditional content centric methods.

    KEY CHARACTERISTICS 

    Structured-oriented
        Uses syntax as a guiding template for the expected response or solution.

    Syntax-focused 
        Uses syntax as a guiding template for the expected response or solution.

    Abstract examples
        Employs abstracted examples as frameworks, illustrating the structure of problems and solutions without focusing on specific details.

    Versatile 
        Applicable across various domains, capable of providing structured responses to a wide range of problems.

    Categorical approach 
        Draws from type theory to emphasize the categorization and logical arrangement of components in a prompt.


Advantages of meta promting over few shot prompting include;
    Token efficiency 
        Reduce the number of tokens required by focusing on structure rather than detailed content.

    Fair comparison 
        Provides a more fair approach for comparing different problem-solving models by minimizing the influence of specific examples.

    zero-shot efficiency
        Can be viewed as a form of zero-shot prompting, where the influence of specific example is minimized.


Applications 
    By focusing on the structural patterns of problem-solving, Meta prompting offers a clear roadmap for navigating complex topics, enhacing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across various domains.
    Applications where meta prompting can be beneficial include but not limited to complex reasoning tasks, mathematical problem-solving, coding challenges, theoretical queries.
