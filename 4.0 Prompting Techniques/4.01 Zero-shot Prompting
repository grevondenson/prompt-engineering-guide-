The zero-shot prompt directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it.
We tried a few zero-shoot examples in the previous section.
Here is an example;
    
    Prompt 
        Classify the text into neutral, negative or postive.
        Text: I think the vacation is okay.
        Sentiment:

    Output
        neutral

Note that in this prompt above we didn't provide the model with any examples of text alongside their classifications, the LLM already understands "sentiment"-- that's the zero-shot capabilities at work.

When zero-shot doesn't work, it's recommended to provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt which leads to few-shot prompting.
in the next section, we demonstrate few-shot prompting.
