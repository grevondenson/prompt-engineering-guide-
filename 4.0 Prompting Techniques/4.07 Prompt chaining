One of the most important prompt engineering techniques is to break tasks into its substacks.
Once the substasks have been is identifing, the LLM is prompted with a substask and then its response is used as in input to another prompt.
This is what's reffered to as prompt chaining, where a task is split into substasks with the idea to create a chain of prompt operations.

Prompt chaining is useful to accomplish complex tasks which an LLM might struggle to address if prompted with a very detailed prompt.
In prompt chaining, chain prompts perform transformations or additional processes on the generated response before raching a final desired state.
Prompt chaining is particularly useful when building LLM-powered conversational assistants and improving the personalization and user experience of your applications.
