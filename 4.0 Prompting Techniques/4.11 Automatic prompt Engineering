        APE

It is a framework of automatic instruction generation and selection.
The instruction generation problem is framed as natural language synthesis addressed as a black-box optimization problem using LLMs to generate and search over candidate solutions.

The first step involves a LLM that is given output demonstration to generate instruction candidates for a task.
These candidates solutions will guide the search procedure.
The instructions are executed using a target model, and then the most appropiate instruction is selected based on computed evaluation scores.

APE discovers a better zero-shot CoT prompt than the human engineered "let's think step by step" prompt.

        KEY TECHNIQUES
            Meta-prompting 
            Using an LLM to act as an "expert prompt engineering" by giving it high-level instructions to design better task-specific prompts.

            Optimization by prompting (OPRO)
            A strategy where the LLM analyzes a history of previous prompts and their scores (an "optimization trajectory") to "hill-climb" toward better solution.

            Gradient-based (soft) prompting
            Optimizing continuous vectors (embeddings) rather than discrete text, often using techniques like prompt tuning.

            Exemplar selection 
            Automatically finding the most effective "few-shot" examples to include in a prompt to guide the model's behaviour.
