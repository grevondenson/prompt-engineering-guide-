A framework that generalize over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermidiate steps for general problem solving with language models.
ToT maintains a tree of thought, where thoughts represent coherent language sequences that serve as intermidiate steps toward solving a problem through a deliberate reasoning process.
The LLms ability to generate and evaluate thoughts is then combined with search algorithms.
    Breadth-first search and depth-first search to enable systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.

A sample ToT prompt is:

    Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
    All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
    then share it with the group.
    Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
    If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
    The question is ......
