 ART work as follows;
    Given a new task, it select demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library.
    At test time, it pauses generation whenever external tools are called, and integrate their output before resuming generation

ART encourages the model to generalize from demonstrations to decompose a new task and use tools in appropiate places, in a zero-shot fashion.
In addition, ART is extensible as it also enables humans to fix mistake in the reasoning steps or add new tools by simply updating the task  and tool libraries.

ART substantially improves over few-shot prompting and automatic CoT on unseen tasks in the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks, and exceeds performance of hand-crafted CoT prompts when human feedback is incorporated 

        KEY ASPECTS OF ART

        System mechanism 
            ART decomposetsks into intermidiate steps which are formulated as code or natural language, then pausing generation to integrate output from external tols.

        Tool integration 
            The system supports, integrating, external tools such as, web search, calculators, or other APIs to solve problems beyond the model core knowledge.
             
        Performance 
            ART provides improved results over standard few shot, prompting and automatic CoT by allowing models to dynamically adapt to new tasks.

        Extensibility 
            Humans can interven by correcting errors in the reasoning steps or by adding new tools to the library which significantly improves performance.
