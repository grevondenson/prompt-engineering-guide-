            CAPABILITIES

    Information synthesis
            LLM excel in summarizing complex reports, extracting key points from long-form text, and sythesizing from fragmented databases.
    Code assistance
            They are proficient at generating and debugging code, which significantly speeds up software development workflows.
    Context generation 
            Modern models can produce high quality articles, marketing copy, and documentation that maintain a concictent brand voice at scale.
    Domain specialization 
            Through fine-tuning and Retrival-augmented generation (RAG), LLMs can provide specialized support in  fields like law and health care. 
    Multimodal reasoning 
            Advanced versions can now process and reason across text,images and audio simultaneously, enabling more natural and complex human computer interactions.


            LIMITATIONS 

    Hallucinations
            LLMs often produce plausible sounding but factually incorrect information, especially when they lack the necessary data to answer a query. 
    Logical & Math stuggles
            While improving, many models still falter on multi-step reasoning tasks or complex mathematical problems where one small error cascades through the solution.
    Knowledge
            most models are stastically frozen at their last training date, meaning they are unaware of recent events unless connected to real-time search tools.
    Context & memory constraints
            Models have a fixed context window and can lose track of information in very long conversations, often treating each interactions as an isolated event.
    Inherent bias 
            Because they learn from internet data, LLMs can produce and amplify societal biases, requiring careful monitoring and saftey filters.
    Lack of genuine understanding 
            LLMs simulate empathy and reasoning through advance autocomplete; they do not posses consciousness or a true understanding of the world.
