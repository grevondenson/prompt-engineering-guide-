Prompt engineering is a relative new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently apply and build with large language models for a wide variety of applications and use cases.

Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs. Researchersuse prompt engineering to improve safety and the capacity of LLMs on a wide rsnge of common and complex tasks such as questions answering and arithmetic reasoning.

Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effictive prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.

This comprehensive guide covers the theory and practical aspects of prompt engineering and how to leverage the best prompting techniques to interact and build with LLMs.
